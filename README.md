# Real-Time Lip-Syncing WebSocket API

Brief project description: This API uses [Chosen AI Model Name, e.g., Wav2Lip] to generate a lip-synced video from an input audio file and a person's image. Communication is handled via WebSockets.

## How it Works

Explain the architecture:
1. A client connects to the WebSocket endpoint `/ws/lipsync`.
2. The client sends a JSON message containing base64 encoded audio and a base64 encoded image of a person.
3. The server decodes the data and saves them as temporary files.
4. The [Chosen AI Model Name] processes the audio and image to generate a lip-synced video. This involves [briefly mention key steps like face detection if applicable, and the main model inference].
5. The output video is encoded to base64 (or a URL is generated).
6. The server sends a JSON response back to the client with the resulting video.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- `ffmpeg` (often required by lip-sync models for video processing, ensure it's in your PATH or installed in Docker)
- For GPU support: NVIDIA drivers and NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host.

## Installation

### Local Setup (Example)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **(If your chosen model's code isn't directly in the repo)**
    Follow instructions to clone/download the AI model's codebase into the correct directory. E.g.:
    ```bash
    # Example for Wav2Lip if you decide to include it as a submodule or cloned directory
    # git clone [https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git) # Or your fork
    # cd Wav2Lip
    # pip install -r requirements.txt # If it has its own
    # cd ..
    ```
    Ensure paths in `main.py` for model scripts are correct.

### Downloading Pretrained Models

Provide clear instructions on where to download the necessary pretrained model files (e.g., `.pth` for PyTorch models) and where to place them.

Example for Wav2Lip:
1.  Download `wav2lip_gan.pth` from [Link to Wav2Lip GAN model].
2.  Download `s3fd_convert.pth` (for face detection) from [Link to S3FD model, if you use their detector].
3.  Place them in a designated directory, e.g., `checkpoints/`:
    ```
    checkpoints/
    ├── wav2lip_gan.pth
    └── s3fd_convert.pth # or other face detector model
    ```
    *Ensure your `main.py` (or the model's inference script it calls) knows where to find these files.*

---

## Running with Docker

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    From the root of the project directory (where your `Dockerfile` is):
    ```bash
    docker build -t lipsync-api .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    * **CPU:**
        ```bash
        docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name lipsync-app lipsync-api
        ```
    * **GPU (if you configured Dockerfile for GPU and have NVIDIA Container Toolkit):**
        ```bash
        docker run -d --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --name lipsync-app lipsync-api
        ```
    The API will be accessible at `ws://localhost:8000/ws/lipsync`.

## API Usage

### WebSocket Endpoint
`ws://<your-server-address>:<port>/ws/lipsync`
(e.g., `ws://localhost:8000/ws/lipsync` when running locally or in Docker)

### Input Format
Send a JSON message with the following structure:
```json
{
  "audio": "<base64_encoded_audio_bytes>",
  "image": "<base64_encoded_image_bytes>"
}
